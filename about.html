                <h2>Suyash Sakhare</h2>
                <p>I am a curious soul who found my passion for filmmaking while studying Astronomy as an undergraduate at the University of Kansas.</p>
                <p>My research has been focused on the CMS detector and the Quarked! public outreach program, which has taught me the value of adaptability and intellectual humility. My journey has taught me that self-doubt can be a motivating factor, and it has pushed me to work harder.</p>
                <p>My ultimate goal is to continue learning about machine learning, cameras, and detectors while creating entertaining and informative content. While the journey may seem daunting, I understand that all I have to do is keep walking towards it. I am excited to see where this path will take me and invite you to come along for the ride.<br></p>
